    <p>
        Grey is my first album/EP. It's a collection of random songs I had made within a span of 5-6 months. <br>
        I consider it to be an EP, but it is listed as an album on all platforms due to the number of songs. <br>
        It was my first attempt at making electronic/ambient music. I had previously made more rock-oriented music, <br>
        such as shoegaze and math rock type stuff. I found it easier to make ambient music, but also more fulfilling.
