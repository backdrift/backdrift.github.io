    <p>
        Suburbia is a score for a film that doesn't exist. This was the idea that got the album started. A coming of age film. <br>
        I started the album in the summer of 2023 with "A Coming Of Age Story" and soon went into a writing drought. <br>
        I couldn't write anything for over year, as I tried to complete the album. I made a first draft towards the end of <br>
        2023, but it didn't sound good. So, for most of 2024, I did not write songs for Suburbia. Towards the end of 2024, however, <br>
        I made "After It Happened" and "Around The Neighborhood", which sparked my writing again. Then within a span of three months, I finished <br>
        the album with tracks 4-9 being written from July to September. Track 4 being the last song I wrote for the album. This is the best <br>
        music I have written and idk if I'll top this.
