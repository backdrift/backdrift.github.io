        Lim is what I consider my first album as I was making the songs, I had the album in mind. There is an extra song here (track 13), <br>
        that is not on any streaming platforms, except SoundCloud, because it is a remix of Just Dance by Lady Gaga. The album also went <br> 
        through a name change, initially it was called Stargazing, but after about a week I regretted choosing that name. It wasn't until <br> 
        about a year after I released it that I changed it to Lim.
